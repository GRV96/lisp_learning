# Lisp Learning

In this repository, I store the code that I write to learn the language Lisp.

Download the compiler and interpreter CLISP.
```
sudo apt install -y clisp
```

Open the CLISP command prompt.
```
clisp
```

Exit the CLISP command prompt.
```
(quit)
```

Execute a Lisp script. The file extension should be `.lisp`.
```
clisp [file name]
```
