# lisp_learning

In this repository, I store the code that I write to learn the language Lisp.

Download the compiler and interpreter CLISP.
```
sudo apt install -y clisp
```

To exit the CLISP command prompt, run this instruction.
```
(cl-user::quit)
```

Run this command to execute a Lisp script.
The file extension should be `.lisp`.
```
clisp [file name]
```
